        "description": "Build rich and collaborative applications using client-side code with React, Redux, and Firebase About This Book 1)A practical guide covering the full stack for web development with React 16 and Firebase 2)Leverage the power of Firebase Cloud Storage, messaging, functions, OAuth, and database security to develop serverless web applications. 3)Develop high-performance applications without the hassle of setting up complex web infrastructure.  ReactJS is a wonderful framework for UI development. Firebase as a backend with React is a great choice as it is easy, powerful, and provides great developer experience. It removes a lot of boilerplate code from your app and allows you to focus on your app to get it out quickly to users. Firebase with React is also a good choice for Most Viable Product (MVP) development. This book provides more practical insights rather than just theoretical concepts and includes basic to advanced examples - from hello world to a real-time seat booking app and Helpdesk application This book will cover the essentials of Firebase and React.js and will take you on a fast-paced journey through building real-time applications with Firebase features such as Cloud Storage, Cloud Function, Hosting and the Realtime Database. We will learn how to secure our application by using Firebase authentication and database security rules. We will leverage the power of Redux to organize data in the front-end, since Redux attempts to make state mutations predictable by imposing certain restrictions on how and when updates can happen. Towards the end of the book you will have improved your React skills by realizing the potential of Firebase to create real-time serverless web applications. Style and approach Practical insights rather than just theoretical concepts while including basic to advanced examples - from hello world to a real-time seat booking app and Helpdesk application.

React is one of the most popular web development tools available today, and Node.js is extremely popular for server-side development. The fact that both utilize JavaScript is a big selling point, but as developers use the language more, they begin to recognize the shortcomings, and that’s where TypeScript comes in and why it’s gaining in popularity quickly. Add Webpack and Docker to the mix, and you’ve got a potent full development stack on which to build applications. You’ll begin by building a solid foundation of knowledge and quickly expand it by constructing two different real-world apps. These aren’t just simple, contrived examples but real apps that you can choose to install on your servers and use for real. By the end, you will have a solid grasp of building apps with React, Node.js, and TypeScript and a good grasp on how Webpack can be used to optimize and organize your code for deployment. You’ll also understand how Docker can be used to run the apps you build in a clear and well-defined way, all of which will be able to springboard you into creating more advanced apps on your own. What You'll Learn Get a project started and logically structure it Construct a user interface with React and Material-UI Use Web Sockets for real-time communication between client and server Build a REST API with Node and Express as another approach to client-server communication Package the app with Webpack for optimized delivery Take a completed app and wrap it up with Docker for easy distribution Review a host of other ancillary topics including NPM, Semantic versioning, Babel, NoSQL, and more Who This Book Is For Web developers with basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and CLI tools who are interested in and in all aspects of application development, and using TypeScript instead of straight JavaScript.

There is also no shortage of details on the various approaches and the interested reader can gain further information on any particular method via the innovative companion book wiki. The book does not assume any high level mathematical or statistical training or even programming experience, so should be accessible to almost anyone willing to invest the time to learn about these methods. It should certainly be required reading for anyone starting a PhD program in this area and will serve as a useful reference as they progress further.

Further on, case studies such as weather prediction, tweet clustering, and movie recommendation engines will show you how to apply these algorithms optimally. Finally, you'll become well versed in techniques that enable parallel processing, giving you the ability to use these algorithms for compute-intensive tasks.\r By the end of this book, you'll have become adept at solving real-world computational problems by using a wide range of algorithms.\r What you will learn\r <br>•\tExplore existing data structures and algorithms found in Python libraries\r <br>•\tImplement graph algorithms for fraud detection using network analysis\r <br>•\tWork with machine learning algorithms to cluster similar tweets and process Twitter data in real time\r <br>•\tPredict the weather using supervised learning algorithms\r <br>•\tUse neural networks for object detection\r <br>•\tCreate a recommendation engine that suggests relevant movies to subscribers\r <br>•\tImplement fool proof security using symmetric and asymmetric encryption on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)\r Who this book is for\r This book is for programmers or developers who want to understand the use of algorithms for problem-solving and writing efficient code. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the most commonly used algorithms in a clear and concise way or an experienced programmer looking to explore cutting-edge algorithms in data science, machine learning, and cryptography, you'll find this book useful. Although Python programming experience is a must, knowledge of data science will be helpful but not necessary.\r  ",
