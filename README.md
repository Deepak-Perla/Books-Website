# About
Made a purely working local host website using HTML, CSS, JS & Bootstrap for Frontend and NodeJS, MongoDB, Firebase, Python used for Backend.

This website mainly contains of books related to all Computer Science subjects. Such as DS, Algos, ML & AI and many more.
Lots of features were added in this website.

This website i.e., webbook is exactly what it sounds like: a book on the web. Traditional book formats like print books and ebooks can start on the web too, but they eventually wind up in an export format â€“ your standard PDF files where you can read online or download even.

PS: This is a team project.
